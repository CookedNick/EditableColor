# EditableColor

A mutable color representation that conforms to `ObservableObject` with automatic, dead-simple bridging to **SwiftUI**, **UIKit**, and **AppKit**.

## Installation

**In Xcode:**
File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency... (https://github.com/DonSwet/EditableColor.git)

## Usage

### Create an instance of `EditableColor`

	import EditableColor
	
	// Start with component values
	let color = EditableColor(red: 1, green: 0, blue: 0, alpha: 1, colorspace: .sRGB)
	
	// OR start with random values
	let color = EditableColor()

### SwiftUI - Display an `EditableColor`

If you simply need to display an instance of `EditableColor` without any special requirements you may do so using the `EditableColor.Display` view type.

	struct ContentView: some View {
		var body: some View {
			// No need to retain the color using @ObservedObject if we wrap it inside of our custom Display type. Updates will occur automatically.
			EditableColor.Display(color)
		}
	}

### SwiftUI - Using `EditableColor` in place of `Color`

If you need to use an `EditableColor` in the form of SwiftUI's native `Color` type, you may do so. Changes made to the `EditableColor` will not reflect in real-time unless it's stored using an `@ObservedObject` or `EnvironmentObject` property wrapper in the relevant view or one of its parents.

	struct ContentView: some View {
		@ObservedObject var color: EditableColor
	
		var body: some View {
			Text("Hello World!")
				.foregroundColor(Color(color))
		}
	}

### UIKit & AppKit

This is a one-time-use bridge. A `UIColor` or `NSColor` instance generated from an `EditableColor` will **not** automatically display changes made to its original `EditableColor`. You'll have to watch for changes using the `Combine` framework methods on `EditableColor` and manually set the color on each update.

	let uiColor = UIColor(color)
	let nsColor = NSColor(color)
